# Operation Digital Butterfly

## The Game
Potential insiders are individuals with privileged access to IT components, IT services, installations, documents or other critical information and devices. Because of their access and knowledge, insider threats are particularly dangerous and at the same time difficult to defend against.


With the tabletop game __Operation Digital Butterfly__, possible attacks by insiders in multiple settings as well as possible countermeasures can be identified. Several teams play the role of malicious insiders and compete against each other.


The game is part of the [LIONS Project](https://www.unibw.de/lions), based on [Operation Digital Ant](https://github.com/NutriSafe-DLT/operation-digital-ant). It is developed by Manfred Hofmeier at the Institute for Protection and Dependability of the Universität der Bundeswehr München.

## Use
The serious game __Operation Digital Butterfly__ is a tabletop game, which can be played both in a face-to-face event and virtually. For a virtual event a video conferencing tool with breakout function is required. Use the digital card deck in such events.
